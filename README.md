## Description
This project allows you to generate README files that are very high quality while being very easy to use for the user.

## Installation
All you would need to do is install a zip of the code or clone it, then make sure you have NodeJS installed, then in the integrated terminal type node index.js to get started using it.

## Usage
When you type in the command you are given multiple prompts that you enter in with your information. Once you finish, a README file should generate within the folder with all the information you have put in.

## Tests
My first test was successful, it was generating the file with ease, and the second test it was getting all the info typed in succesfully as well.

## Credits
Credits go to my instuctor for the bootcamp, for helping us out get an idea with what to do.
